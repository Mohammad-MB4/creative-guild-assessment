# creative-guild-assessment

The whole process was simple to integrate.
I used React framework for frontend and Laravel for backend. These are the tools I like to use because of their flexibility and modern development. With more time, I definitely can make a better application. I didn't save the images into any online source like amazon S3 for this assessment and just used local routing for it. I also used phpmyadmin for my database (SQL). Using REST APIs, we can navigate through the app, authenticate the user etc. I could also work more on the form validation, error handling, responsive design and fixing a few small bugs from my error handling but I suppose the current version would do the trick for now. Thank You!
