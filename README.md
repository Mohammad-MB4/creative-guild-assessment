# creative-guild-assessment

The whole process was simple to integrate.
I used React framework for frontend and Laravel for backend. These are the tools I like to use because of their flexibility and modern development. With more time, I definitely can make a better application. I didn't save the images into any online source like amazon S3 for this assessment and just used local routing for it. I also used phpmyadmin for my database (SQL). Using REST APIs, we can navigate through the app, authenticate the user etc. I could also work more on the form validation, error handling, responsive design and fixing a few small bugs from my error handling but I suppose the current version would do the trick for now. Thank You!

It works with a SQL database and the app is easily runable after migrations are runned on a database. register an account and you will be redirected to the home page and the static data that are saved on your account along with your own information will be showed to you. you can also log out and log back in if you desire. the data shown are specific to the user and no unauthenticated user is allowed to see other user's data.
